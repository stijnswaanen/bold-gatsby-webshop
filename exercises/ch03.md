1. let Gatsby generate pages for all sweaters coming from Drupal and make use of the product template.
Don't forget the query variable!

You may use the properties of ProductsPage query for this.
There are also some additional properties for this page to work. You can find these under relationships (same level as field_image) > product_variation__sweater.
The properties are:
- id
- title
- price > formatted

2. provide the correct links to the product detail page in
- products overview
- featured products component

This exercise is completed when you have a fully functional product detail page where you can add products to your cart.
