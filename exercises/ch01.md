1. create product list page:
- enable drupal source plugin

- map result on products page to ProductCard

2. create a `featured-product` component
- place it on the homepage
- make a graphql query of allProductSweater with the following properties: node.id, node.title & node.description, a limit of 4 and a filter on field_featured_product which is true
-- make use of the right query method here because it's a component.
